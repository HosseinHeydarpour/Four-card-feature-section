## My process
I leveraged CSS grid to create a responsive layout for the page and the cards. I also used flex-box to align the content within each card. For this challenge, I adopted SASS and BEM to write modular and maintainable code

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow




### What I learned

Positioning the cards was the most challenging part of this challenge, which helped me improve my CSS grid skills even more!

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:



### Continued development

 I really look forward to tackling challenges that require JS.
